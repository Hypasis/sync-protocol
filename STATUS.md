## Running the Current Code

### Quick Test

```bash
# Install dependencies
go mod download

# Build
make build

# Run (uses mock data)
./hypasis-sync --data-dir=./data

# Check status
curl http://localhost:8080/api/v1/status
```

### What Works Now

- ✅ Service starts and initializes
- ✅ Mock checkpoints are loaded
- ✅ Forward and backward sync run (with mock data)
- ✅ REST API responds to queries
- ✅ Metrics are exposed
- ✅ Gap tracking works correctly
- ⚠️ No actual blockchain data (mocked)
- ⚠️ No real P2P networking (TODO)
- ⚠️ No persistent storage (in-memory only)

## Known Issues

1. **Mock Data Only**: Currently uses mock blocks and checkpoints
2. **No P2P**: Cannot connect to real blockchain networks
3. **In-Memory Storage**: Data lost on restart
4. **No Validation**: Blocks not validated against consensus rules
5. **Single Chain**: Only Polygon structure implemented

## Next Steps for Development

### Immediate (This Week)

1. Implement basic devp2p networking
2. Add LevelDB storage backend
3. Integrate with Polygon testnet (Amoy)
4. Write unit tests for core components

### Short Term (Next Month)

1. Full Polygon PoS integration
2. Checkpoint fetching from Ethereum L1
3. Block validation logic
4. Performance benchmarking

### Medium Term (2-3 Months)

1. Production-ready deployment
2. Security audit
3. Documentation completion
4. Community alpha testing

### Long Term (3-6 Months)

1. Multi-chain support
2. Mainnet deployment
3. Performance optimizations
4. Developer SDK
